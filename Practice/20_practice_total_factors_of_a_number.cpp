/*
Goal: To calculate and print all the factors of a given number.

Example: 12 â†’ 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12

Optimization Idea:
- A factor is any number that divides the given number completely.
- No factor (except the number itself) is greater than number/2.
- So we check from 2 to number/2 to find remaining factors.
