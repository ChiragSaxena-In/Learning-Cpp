# Sorting Algorithms

## What is Sorting?
Sorting is the process of arranging elements in a particular order,
usually in ascending or descending order.

Example:
Before: 5 1 4 2 8  
After : 1 2 4 5 8

## Why Sorting is Important
- Makes searching faster
- Used in databases and operating systems
- Required in many DSA problems
- Improves data readability

---

## Types of Sorting
- Comparison Based Sorting
- Non-Comparison Based Sorting

---

## Stable vs Unstable Sorting

Stable Sort:
Preserves the relative order of equal elements.

Unstable Sort:
Does not guarantee order of equal elements.

## In-Place Sorting
An in-place algorithm uses constant extra memory.
